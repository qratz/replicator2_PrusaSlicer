# Makerbot Replicator 2 in PrusaSlicer
This is only tested on the Makerbot Replicator 2 running the latest Sailfish v7.8 firmware.
Install the firmware according to the instructions on [Sailfish](https://www.sailfishfirmware.com/).
To automatically generate .x3g-files, a postprocessing script is run from the print configuration.
This requires [GPX](https://github.com/markwal/GPX) to be installed on the system and located at /usr/bin/gpx.

On ubuntu just run:
```
sudo apt install gpx
```

finally:

checkout this repo to ~/.config/PrusaSlicer/
